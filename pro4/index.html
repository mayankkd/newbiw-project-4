                            <p>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                                transition
                                and
                                have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free

                                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-
                                and
                                most
                                grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched

                <p>" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                    agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
                    that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example
                    of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!</p>
